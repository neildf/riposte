/**
 * Interface describing an object that knows how to deal with endpoint-related metrics. Depending on what metrics
 * reporter(s) you're using and where those metrics end up, you may want to handle endpoint metrics differently - for
 * example, some systems like Graphite might want separate specially-named metrics for everything, while others
 * like SignalFx might want a more compact set of metrics with various dimensions carved out via metadata from their
 * custom reporters. This interface lets you choose how endpoint metrics are handled. Note that a
 * {@link com.nike.riposte.metrics.codahale.impl.EndpointMetricsHandlerDefaultImpl} will be used by default if you
 * don't specify a custom one when setting up your {@link CodahaleMetricsListener}.
