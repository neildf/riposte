/**
 * Interface for an endpoint. Concrete implementations must implement {@link #requestMatcher()} to define what requests
 * they want to handle. If your endpoint expects request body content (e.g. POST or PUT requests) then you'll probably
 * want to override {@link #requestContentType()} to return a non-null value so that the request body content is
 * deserialized into the expected object type for you. NOTE: Rather than require every endpoint to override {@link
 * #requestContentType()} you might consider determining it dynamically in the constructor of a base class using
 * reflection magic similar to how {@link TypeReference} itself works - see the source code of the {@link
 * TypeReference#TypeReference()} constructor for details ({@code StandardEndpoint} does this if you want a more direct
 * example).
 * <p/>
 * An {@code execute(...)} type method is not defined here since different endpoint types will have different
 * requirements for arguments they take in as well as what they return, however the typical endpoint is {@code
 * StandardEndpoint} from {@code riposte-core} and is usually what you want your endpoints to extend.
