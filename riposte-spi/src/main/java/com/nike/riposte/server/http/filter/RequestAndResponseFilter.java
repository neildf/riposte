/**
 * Interface representing a request/response filter. These can be used similarly to servlet filters in that they give
 * you an opportunity to adjust (or even replace) the incoming request before a destination endpoint is determined and
 * called, and adjust (or replace) the outgoing response before it is sent to the caller. Typical use cases would be for
 * adding, removing, or modifying headers based on overall application rules so that each endpoint doesn't have to
 * reimplement the same logic.
 *
 * <p>The request filter side carries the useful possibility of "short circuiting" the request, where request processing
 * would jump straight from the short circuiting filter directly to sending a response (provided by the short circuiting
 * filter), completely bypassing any endpoint. Perfect for CORS support. If your filter may need to short circuit you
 * should use {@link ShortCircuitingRequestAndResponseFilter} interface that extends this interface instead of this
 * interface directly.
 *
 * <p>This base {@link RequestAndResponseFilter} is configured for a non-short-circuiting filter, namely {@link
 * #isShortCircuitRequestFilter()} returns false and the short circuiting methods are defaulted to throw a {@link
 * UnsupportedOperationException} since they should never be called when {@link #isShortCircuitRequestFilter()} if
 * false. As stated earlier, you should use {@link ShortCircuitingRequestAndResponseFilter} when building a short
 * circuiting filter for convenience since it reverses these decisions. </p> <p> See the method javadocs for details on
 * implementing a request and/or response filter. Hook them up to your application by having {@link
 * ServerConfig#requestAndResponseFilters()} return them.
 *
 * <p>Finally, there are some use cases where request filters should run before security validation, and other use cases
 * where they should run after. You can choose on a per-filter basis whether it runs before or after security
 * validation - see {@link #shouldExecuteBeforeSecurityValidation()} for details.
