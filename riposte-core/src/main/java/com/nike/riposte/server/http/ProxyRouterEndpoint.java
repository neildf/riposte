     * contains HTTP status code and headers - the payload is not available, so the HTTP status code and/or headers are
     * the only things you can modify. <br/> If you need to inspect and/or alter the response *payload* then you
     * shouldn't be using a {@link ProxyRouterEndpoint}, you should be using a normal {@link StandardEndpoint} instead
     * and making your downstream call with an HTTP client (ideally an async nonblocking client like {@code
     * AsyncHttpClientHelper}) so you can do whatever you want with the response payload before returning to the
     * caller.
     * <p/>
     * By default this method does nothing. Override this method if you need alternate behavior.

     * <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> This method is powerful - be careful with it. In particular if you do something expensive
     * in here you could be blocking Netty I/O worker threads, severely bottlenecking your application. If you need to
     * do something expensive like make an HTTP call to another service to report on the result of this call, then do
     * that asynchronously so that this method returns almost instantly.
     *
     * TODO: Investigate having this return a {@code CompletableFuture} instead so we don't have to worry about blocking
     * worker threads. That change would need careful testing to make sure we don't break exception handling (what
     * happens if an error occurs in the CompletableFuture?), and would need performance testing to make sure it doesn't
     * do much to affect throughput in the normal case where this method does nothing. Seems like an unlikely use case
     * though, so maybe wait until it's asked for?

     *     Executor, ChannelHandlerContext)} before the downstream system was called. If you need to calculate something
     *     in {@link #getDownstreamRequestFirstChunkInfo(RequestInfo, Executor, ChannelHandlerContext)} and want to pass
     *     it into this method you can pass it via the {@link RequestInfo#getRequestAttributes()} map and it will be
